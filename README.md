# trec
WAD2 TREC evaluator

Remember, the folder and git repository are called trec but the project is called treceval
and the web app itself is trec_eval_app

Don't be confused by the folder called treceval, that just contains data for the whole project

The password for the database should be "password" and the username is "superusername"
I also created a new email which is trec2016 at gmail dot com with the password trecpassword since django wanted one

In order to get the web app running, first cd into the /trec/evaluator/trec_eval.9.0/ directory and enter the 'make' command.
Then cd back into /trec/ and run 'python populate_trec.py'
